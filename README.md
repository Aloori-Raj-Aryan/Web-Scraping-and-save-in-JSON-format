This Webscraping code visited 30 web-links in which a novel is stored as chapters.
The same code may not work for all websites as the web design changes to website to website.
The data is first converted to dictionary.
The dictionary has a structure as shown in cell 2.
Then it is converted to json format and stored in the pc.
The resulting json file is also uploaded.
