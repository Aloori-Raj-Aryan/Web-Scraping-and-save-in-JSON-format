Both Rank 2 and Rank 3 Human Class Martial Soul were common Martial Souls and were considered mediocre.', 'Many people in the martial practice field fixed their eyes on two young men who were standing in the front row.', 'One was dressed in teal clothes, and the other one was wearing purple clothes. They were both quite handsome.', 'The young man in teal was called Su Mo, the young master of the Sus and the son of the Master of the Sus.', 'The young man in purple was the son of the First Elder of the Sus.', 'They both were seeded disciples with great talents among all inferiors, especially Su Mo.', 'The young master had accomplished Lv 9 Body Tempering Realm at the age of 15, and he was endowed with the highest talent among all inferiors.', 'Therefore, everyone looked forward to seeing what levels of Martial Souls they would awaken.', 'In the first row, Su Yu, dressed in purple clothes, glanced at Su Mo, who was next to him. He sneered and said, “You’re called the top genius of the entire Su clan. I hope that you can awaken a Martial Soul that is well worthy of your identity.”', 'The eyes of Su Yu were full of sarcasm. He had an extremely high talent, but Su Mo was spoken more highly of than him in the Su clan.', 'The so-called nickname of top genius made Su Mo so famous that he stole Su Yu’s honors.', 'As a result, Su Yu could only be second to him every time.', 'Su Yu was so furious, because even the lady he liked had a crush on Su Mo.', 'Now, his opportunity had finally arrived. As long as he could awaken a Martial Soul with a higher level than that of Su Mo, he would claim the title of first genius among the Sus.', 'However, Su Mo was unprovoked. He did not say anything, because he clearly knew Su Yu’s hostility toward him.', 'Then, the hosting elder exclaimed,', '“Next up, Su Mo!”', 'Su Mo instantly strode onto the altar.', 'Right at this moment, all people fixed their eyes on him and the entire martial practice field immediately quietened. They were wondering what the level of Martial Soul Su Mo, the first genius of the Su clan, could awaken.', 'After entering the altar, Su Mo sat cross-legged with his eyes tightly closed.', 'Glowing runes emerged consecutively beneath the altar and entered into Su Mo’s body.', 'The surrounding disciples of the Sus started to whisper after Su Mo entered the altar.', '“Can you guess which level of Martial Soul brother Su Mo can awaken?”', '“As the young master, the level of his Martial Soul must be very high.”', '“You’re right. He has accomplished Lv 9 Body Tempering Realm at less than 15 years old, so he’ll awaken a Martial Soul with an extremely high level.”', 'Amidst the disciples’ heated discussion, more and more sparkling runes floated above the altar and enveloped Su Mo’s body.', 'With his legs crossed and eyes closed, Su Mo started to breathe quickly, and roaring sounds gradually arose.', 'Everyone stopped breathing and stared closely at the altar.', 'Boom!', 'Finally, with a mighty booming sound, a dark shadow abruptly rose from his body.', 'This dark shadow was a huge vortex, inside which was a bottomless black hole, making people feel a chill.', 'At the same time, a yellow halo appeared above the shadow.', 'Ah!', 'All the Sus were instantly glassy-eyed.', '“Why is there only one halo?”', '“His Martial Soul is Rank 1 Human Class?”', '“How is this possible?”', 'Everyone was stunned, and even Su Yu felt startled with his mouth agape.', 'He had not expected that Su Mo would only awaken a Rank 1 Human Class Martial Soul.', 'The Rank 1 Human Class Martial Soul was the lowest one and totally useless.', 'Seated on the altar with his legs crossed, Su Mo slowly opened his eyes. He was also dumbfounded when he saw his Martial Soul.', '“Rank 1 Human Class Martial Soul…” Su Mo murmured with a bitter smile on his lips. He had never thought that he would awaken a lowest rank Martial Soul.', 'After a while, everyone regained consciousness, and the martial practice field was suddenly in an uproar.', '“Oh my, my eyes must be playing tricks on me. It’s a Rank 1 Human Class Martial Soul, the totally useless one?”', '“He awakened a useless Martial Soul. Crap, I can’t believe I anticipated for so long!”', '“He isn’t a genius, but the most useless person in our clan!”', '“…”', 'All the spectators were talking about the matter, and all the elders and inferiors of the Sus changed their view of Su Mo.', 'They used to look at him with respect and admiration, but now, they were looking at him with disappointment and contempt.', 'On the altar, Su Mo managed to slowly stand up with his fists clenched.', 'He looked around and saw their expressions.“What snobbish people they are!”Su Mo smiled satirically in his heart.', 'Previously, when he was considered to be highly talented, all of them showed their respect to him. Wherever he went, they all swarmed to him and kissed his ass.', 'Now, after he awakened a useless Martial Soul, they all instantly looked at him with contempt.', 'After a while, Su Mo took a deep breath and strode off the altar.', '“Next one, Su Yu!” exclaimed the hosting elder.', 'Glancing at Su Mo, he shook his head secretly. The former genius was a genius no more!', 'Upon hearing this, Su Yu walked toward the altar with a prideful look.', 'When he passed by Su Mo, he coldly laughed and disdainfully said, “I used to regard you as my rival. But from now on, the rivalry is gone, and I’ll tread you under my foot forever!”', 'Su Yu felt extremely happy. Now that Su Mo had awakened the lowest rank Martial Soul, Su Mo would not even be eligible to lick his shoes.', 'Even if he awakened a bad Martial Soul, it would still be higher than Su Mo’s.', 'Su Yu strode onto the altar after saying these words.', 'Without responding to his provocation, Su Mo returned to the martial practice field and calmly observed the ceremony.', 'Standing in the martial practice field, he felt some disparaging eyes fixed upon him and saw the disdainful expressions of disciples around him.', 'Su Mo’s heart could not stop twitching. After all, the feeling of falling from heaven to hell was indeed torture.', 'Now, Su Yu sat on the altar cross-legged. The glowing runes emerged from the black alter and all entered his body.', 'The martial practice field quieted down again, and everyone looked forward to seeing his Martial Soul.', 'Su Mo had awakened a useless Martial Soul, so it was impossible that Su Yu would awaken another useless one.', 'Otherwise, the Sus would become a joke in Sunnywood City.', 'Howl!', 'As everyone was anticipating, a beast’s roar abruptly came out from Su Yu’s body.', 'A giant virtual shadow of a snake rose above the head of him, triumphantly.', 'There were five dazzling yellow halos around the python’s shadow.', 'The hosting elder was stunned at the sight of his Martial Soul. Then, he shouted excitedly, “Five halos! It’s a Rank 5 Human Class Martial Soul —Iron-scaled Python.”', 'The Rank 5 Human Class Martial Soul was the highest one in all of Sunnywood City. Finally, another genius had appeared in the Sus.', 'The entire martial practice field fell into silence at the sight of Su Yu’s Martial Soul.', 'Then, it was in an uproar again.', '“Rank 5 Human Class Martial Soul!”', '“Haha! The top genius appeared in the Su clan.”', '“Brother Su Yu turned out to be the first genius of our Su clan. Su Mo is nothing!”', '“You’re right! Su Mo only has a useless Martial Soul. He can’t be compared with Su Yu!”', 'All disciples of the Sus looked at Su Yu with admiration.', 'On the altar, Su Yu saw that he awakened a Rank 5 Human Class Martial Soul and heard the surprise and admiration from the crowd.', 'A thick of pride arose in his heart and felt that everything was beautiful. He was full of high spirits and thought that no one could rival him.', 'He arrogantly turned to Su Mo and looked at him with eyes full of sarcasm, as if to say, “I will always tread you under my foot from now on.”', 'After seeing Su Yu’s proud look and hearing the praise from the crowd, Su Mo sighed in his heart and left the martial practice field.']}, 'Chapter 2': {'Name': 'The Previous and Present Lives', 'Translator': 'Transn', 'Editor': 'Transn', 'Story': ['Su Mo went straight back to his yard after leaving the martial practice field.', 'Sitting on a stone bench, he moped over what happened at the awakening ceremony.', 'He was also surprised that he had such a low-rank Martial Soul.', '“It’s been 14 years!” Su Mo murmured distractedly.', 'He was actually not born in this world and came from the Earth.', 'He had been a mercenary in the 21st century. To be exact, he was a king of mercenaries, a legendary hero in the field.', 'As an orphan, he had lived with his relatives since he was a child. At the age of 17, he decided to drop out of school and join the army.', 'After two years’ training, Su Mo was recruited into the strongest special forces in China for his excellent martial skills and soon became the top member of the special forces.', 'Within four years, Su Mo had successfully executed nearly 100 national military missions.', 'Su Mo had thought that he would devote his entire life to his motherland, to the army. But unfortunately, he had got discharged from the army for an accident and left the army dismally.', 'After returning home, he could not fit into normal society or find a job because he had no diploma, skills, or network.', 'Half sitting around for six months, Su Mo decided to embark on a new journey.', 'He enlisted several past comrades in arms and formed Dragon Soul, a small mercenary organization.', 'In the ensuing years, Su Mo and the Dragon Soul Mercenary Group travelled all over the world.', 'They were on the spot in all wars, including ones in Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia.', 'The Dragon Soul Mercenary Group developed rapidly from its initial size of a few people into dozens, hundreds, and finally, thousands of people.', 'It went from an unknown small organization into a powerful mercenary army that ruled over a dark world.', 'Dragon Soul Mercenary had never failed its missions. For the right price, the organization could accomplish any mission, like destroying the army of a small country or overthrowing governments.', 'Last year, Dragon Soul Mercenary even defeated Blackblood Mercenary, which used to be the top mercenary organization in the world, thus becoming the new ruler of the mercenary field.', 'As the leader of Dragon Soul Mercenary, Su Mo was regarded as king of all mercenaries.', 'One could say that his name remained a taboo in the dark world. When he stomped his foot, the entire dark world would shake.', 'However, no one could keep his shoes dry if he always walked along the riverside. In the end, he was completely betrayed!', 'He was sold out by his most trusted brothers and died with his enemies in a trap.', 'After being in this world for 14 years, he was fully adapted and had almost completely forgotten his previous life.', 'He was greatly curious about this world, which was a very magical place that was completely different from Earth.', 'This continent was called Firmament and Continent and had a vast and unmeasurable landscape.', 'This world highly revered martial arts and believed in survival of the fittest. The strong were worshipped like kings, while the weak were crushed like ants.', 'If a person could achieve grand completion in cultivation, he would possess the most powerful skills and could travel to anywhere he wanted in the universe.', 'A powerful martial artist could access unlimited power, status, money and women.', 'In order to become a powerful martial artist, one needed to awaken his Martial Soul, absorb Spiritual Qi from the heaven and earth, fortify his body, and refine his genuine Qi.', 'There were countless types of Martial Souls with varying levels of strength.', 'They were divided into three classes, namely heaven, earth and human class, each of which was classified into nine ranks.', 'The higher a martial artist’s level of Martial Soul, the stronger his power and potential were, and the faster his ability to cultivate was.', 'After coming to this world, Su Mo had worked very hard to cultivate.', 'He did this because he wanted to explore this big and exciting world.', 'In his previous life, he had been a powerful man and ruled the whole world.', 'In this present life, he still wanted to be a strong man who could overlook others.', 'However, today’s Martial Soul awakening ceremony was a humbling slap to the face.', 'His dream was wonderful, but the reality was much too cruel.', 'Suddenly, a deep voice sounded at the door and brought him back to his senses.', '“Mo’er.”', 'The voice belonged to a tall and solemn middle-aged man. He was Su Hong, the Master of the Sus.', 'Upon seeing Su Mo, Su Hong tried to comfort him, saying, “Stop thinking about your Martial Soul. You may have a weaker one, but if you try your hardest to cultivate, you’ll still become powerful one day.”', 'Su Mo gave him a bitter smile, thinking,“My Martial Soul isn’t just weaker. It’s the weakest one.”', '“Don’t worry, Father. I’ll work harder!” he said, forcing a smile.', 'He knew that his father was comforting him.', 'Everyone knew that the level of one’s Martial Soul decided his future accomplishments. The stronger the Martial Soul one awakened, the further one would go in martial arts.', 'This was an indisputable law.', 'It was impossible for him to become powerful with his Rank 1 Human Class Martial Soul.', '“Good.” Su Hong nodded.', 'He took out a jade jar and handed it to Su Mo, saying, “This is a Qi Condensation Elixir that’ll help you break through your cultivation and enter the Qi Cultivation Realm.”', '“Father…”', 'Su Mo felt his heart ache. After he awakened a Rank 1 Human Class Martial Soul, he would be considered as a total failure to cultivate.', 'Qi Condensation Elixir was so priceless that the Sus could not have bought it for him, so Su Hong must have bought it with his own money.', 'Su Mo accepted this elixir, and the two chatted for a while before Su Hong left.', '“What type of Martial Soul have I awakened?”', 'Su Mo was not in a haste to take the elixir after his father left. Instead, he sat cross-legged in his room and released his Martial Soul.', 'A dark vortex surrounded by a shining yellow halo suspended quietly above him.', '“What special skills does it have? I’d better cultivate it for a while.”', 'Su Mo calmed his heart, used his mind to connect with the Martial Soul, and sensed the Spiritual Qi from heaven and earth', 'The black vortex began to slowly rotate, and the center of the vortex emitted a strong suction force.', 'Wisps of Spiritual Qi converged toward Su Mo and entered his body.', 'He was soon immersed in cultivating and drove his Martial Soul to continuously absorb the Spiritual Qi.', 'After a long time, Su Mo stopped.', 'He opened his eyes with a hint of surprise.', '“My Martial Soul is Rank 1 Human Class, but its cultivating pace equals the speed of Rank 2 Human Class.”', 'Su Mo had met many martial artists whose Martial Souls were of the Rank 2 Human Class, and his Martial Soul was no worse than theirs.', 'This unexpected surprise greatly alleviated his depression.', 'After some pondering, Su Mo realized that this speed was probably related to the property of his Martial Soul.', 'His Martial Soul was a vortex which naturally had the property of suction.', 'Therefore, it was normal for his Martial Soul to absorb Spiritual Qi at a speed that equaled that of Rank 2 Human Class Martial Soul.', 'He took out the Qi Condensation Elixir his father had given to him and prepared to enter the Qi Cultivation Realm.', 'At the beginning of the martial arts journey, one must complete Lv 9 Body Tempering Realm. Then, one could awaken the Martial Soul to absorb Spiritual Qi, refine genuine Qi, and enter the Qi Cultivation Realm.', 'Only after entering the Qi Cultivation Realm would one be considered a true martial artist.', 'As soon as he swallowed the Qi Condensation Elixir, its effects immediately surged throughout his body.', 'Su Mo hurriedly ushered its powers into his elixir field and started to refine genuine Qi.', 'Time slowly passed. After four hours, Su Mo abruptly opened his eyes, and a sliver of light flashed in his eyes.', 'At this moment, a mass of vaporous genuine Qi had gathered in his elixir field.', 'The Qi Condensation Elixir was proven to be worthy and had helped him enter Lv 1 Qi Cultivation Realm.']}, 'Chapter 3': {'Name': 'Ninefold Ocean Wave Fist', 'Translator': 'Transn', 'Editor': 'Transn', 'Story': ['The next morning,Su Mo got up early, freshened up, and headed into the Book Collection Pavilion.', 'The Book Collection Pavilion, a four-storey tower, was where the Sus stored scrolls of martial arts.', 'Before Su Mo had awakened his Martial Soul, he could only study the elementary martial arts on the first floor. Now that he had awakened his Martial Soul, and his cultivation was at Lv 1 Qi Cultivation Realm, he could choose cultivation skill and martial skill suited for him.', 'There were nine levels of cultivation skill and martial skill.', 'Each level was divided into three grades: Lower, Medium, and Upper.', 'Martial artists who used higher grade cultivation skill were naturally more powerful.', '“Elder, I want to choose a scroll on the second floor,” Su Mo said, saluting the pavilion protector as he stepped into the Book Collection Pavilion.', '“The second floor?”', 'The pavilion protector, a fat old man, said indifferently, “Su Mo, the second floor can only be accessed by those whose cultivation is at the Qi Cultivation Realm. No exceptions.”', '“I know that, elder. My cultivation is at Lv 1 Qi Cultivation Realm,” Su Mo nodded and said.', '“Lv 1 Qi Cultivation Realm?” The pavilion protector was stunned. Then, he said with a cold expression, “Su Mo, you just awakened your Martial Soul yesterday, and it was at Rank 1 Human Class. How could you be at the Qi Cultivation Realm so soon with that crappy Martial Soul? Even if you had a Rank 3 Human Class Martial Soul, it wouldn’t be possible. Are you kidding me?”', '“Humph! You’ll see!”', 'Su Mo released an aura of Lv 1 Qi Cultivation Realm with a serious expression.', 'Then, he turned around and went up to the second floor of the Book Collection Pavilion, leaving the pavilion protector behind.', '“He… he did it!”', 'The pavilion protector was stunned, but then he laughed disdainfully and said to himself, “The Master must have given him some precious elixir, but he still won’t be able to go much further with his crappy Martial Soul.”', 'Su Mo went to the second floor and saw rows of antique bookshelves, which were full of scrolls.', 'The Sus was one of two main clans in Sunnywood City, so they had many cultivation skills and martial skills. There were almost 100 scrolls on the second floor of the Book Collection Pavilion.', 'A tall young man was browsing the scrolls there.', '“Su Mo!”', 'The young man was initially surprised to see Su Mo, but then he glared at him with complete disdain.', '“Su Heng!” Su Mo glanced back at him.', 'Su Heng also awakened a Martial Soul yesterday. His Martial Soul was of Rank 4 Human Class Martial Soul, which was not as good as Su Yu’s, but a high rank nonetheless.', 'Since Su Heng was on the second floor, his cultivation must have also reached the Qi Cultivation Realm.', '“Well, this is unexpected, Su Mo. I heard yesterday that the Master bought a ‘Qi Condensation Elixir’ from the Herbs Shop, which is probably what you used to increase your cultivation!”', 'Su Heng looked at Sumo and said disdainfully, “Otherwise, you wouldn’t even be able to reach the Qi Cultivation Realm with that crappy Rank 1 Human Class Martial Soul.”', '“It’s none of your business how I got this cultivation,” Su Mo said coldly. Then, he began to browse the manuals and ignored him.', 'Su Mo knew Su Heng very well.', 'When Su Mo was still considered the top genius of the Sus, Su Heng had fawned on him, and Su Mo had been very kind to him.', 'However, Su Heng now had a completely different attitude towards Su Mo.', '“Humph! So much for being a genius. You’re nothing but a piece of trash!” Su Heng snorted and continued selecting his manuals.', 'Su Mo picked up a manual in the cultivation skill category and began reading it.', '“Raging Fire Skill.Medium Lv 1 Cultivation Skill. The Genuine Qi cultivated through this method has extremely powerful fire power and has a very strong attack…”', 'Su Mo continued to browse after reading a few pages of this book.', 'He wanted to read a few more manuals to choose the most suitable cultivation skill.', 'All of the manuals on this floor were at Medium Lv 1.

He could recognize that it was extraordinary.', 'He opened the manual excitedly.“Ninefold Ocean Wave Fist.Medium Lv 1 Martial Skill. The body is like the sea, and the fist is like a wave. The fist force has many levels, and each level is stronger than the previous one.”', '“This is the one!”After reading for a moment, Su Mo nodded with satisfaction.', 'As he was about to leave with the two manuals, Su Heng suddenly blocked him.', '“Su Mo, put downNinefold Ocean Wave Fist,”Su Heng shouted arrogantly.', 'Su Mo glanced at him and asked, “Why should I?”', '“I was thinking about taking that manual, and I’ve decided that I want it, so give it back to me!” Su Heng raised his chin and ordered.', '“Give it back to you? It was never yours!”', 'Su Mo scoffed and said, “The book is mine now, so you’re not getting it.”', '“Are you sure?” Su Heng’s eyes grew cold, and he said, “Su Mo, do you know what the consequences of angering me are?”', '“What consequences?” Su Mo smiled and said, “I have no idea. Please tell me.”', '“You’re a piece of trash, but you’re still so arrogant.” Su Heng shouted furiously, “Su Mo, I’ll say it again. Give it to me, kneel, and apologize, or I’ll break your legs.”', '“Kneel and apologize, or you’ll break my legs?”', 'A cold light flashed in Su Mo’s eyes, and he said indifferently, “I’d like to see you try!”', '“You’re courting death!”', 'Su Heng shouted, and his spirit of Lv 1 Qi Cultivation Realm exploded. A yellow light shone behind him, which meant that he was arousing his Martial Soul to attack.', '“Stop it!”', 'At that moment, the pavilion protector said with an icy voice, “No fighting in the Book Collection Pavilion, or you’ll be banned for life!”', 'These words stopped Su Heng.', '“Elder, I’m sorry. I won’t violate the rules,” Su Heng said hastily to the elder, stifling his anger.', 'Even though he wanted to teach Su Mo a lesson, Su Heng did not dare to violate the rules.', 'It would be a great loss if he was banned from the Book Collection Pavilion for life.', '“Today is your lucky day. I won’t let you off next time,” Su Heng turned to Su Mo and snarled.', '“Idiot!” Su Mo glanced at him and turned to leave.', '“What did you say?”', 'Su Heng became furious again.

Do you know your place?”', 'The Fourth Elder laughed and said with a sneer, “Su Mo, I told you so!”', 'Su Mo walked up to Su Heng and said, “Su Heng, you call me a piece of trash and a good-for-nothing, but let me ask you this: if you find out you’re not as good as me, what does that make you?”', '“I’m not as good as you? Haha! This is the funniest joke I’ve ever heard.” Su Heng sneered.', 'Not as good as Su Mo?', 'He had to be joking.', 'Su Mo’s eyes glinted coldly, and he said with a smile, “Su Heng, I’m issuing you a challenge. Do you dare to accept it?”', 'His words silenced everyone.', 'They all looked at Su Mo in disbelief.', 'Su Mo actually challenged Su Heng?', 'Su Heng was also stunned. After he awakened a Martial Soul of the Rank 4 Human Class, his position in the clan rose greatly, and he was awarded many family resources, which allowed him to reach Lv 3 Qi Cultivation Realm.', 'Yet, this good-for-nothing Su Mo still dared to challenge him?', 'The Fourth Elder was the first to respond. He said to Su Heng in a hurry, “Since he wants to challenge you, you should teach him a lesson.”', 'Su Mo’s earlier provocation had angered him. As an elder, he could not directly punish his inferior, but luckily, Su Mo presented the opportunity himself.', '“Haha! Don’t worry, Fourth Elder! I definitely won’t disappoint you!”', 'Su Heng smiled and walked towards Su Mo, his eyes flickering with malice.', 'Ever since Su Mo provoked him in the Book Collection Pavilion, he had been looking for an opportunity to teach him a lesson!', 'This unexpected challenge greatly excited him.', '“Su Mo, how many moves of mine can you endure? Three? Or just one?”', 'Now that he was about to beat up Su Mo, he was in a very good mood.', 'Su Mo lifted his index finger and shook it.', '“Haha! You’re quite self-aware! At least, you’re aware that you can only endure one move.” Su Heng chuckled.', '“No! I mean I only need one move to deal with you,” Su Mo shook his head and said calmly.', 'Su Mo was not being cocky. Even without using genuine Qi, his physical strength was far more powerful than that of a martial artist of Level 3 Qi Cultivation Realm, rivaling the power of a martial artist of Level 4.', '“One Move!”', 'Everyone was shocked by Su Mo’s words and thought he was a retard.', 'Even between martial artists of the same level, it was rare for one to defeat the other with one move. Never mind Su Mo, whose cultivation was much lower than Su Heng’s.', 'Defeating Su Heng with one move! They really had no idea if Su Mo was conceited or idiotic!', '“Defeat me with one move?”', 'Su Heng became unpleasant. He did not think a piece of trash like Su Mo would dare look down on him like this.', '“If I don’t cripple you today, my name won’t be Su Heng!”', 'Boom!', 'With a roar, Su Heng immediately released his Martial Soul, and four yellow halos shined behind him.', 'Rank 4 Human Class Martial Soul!', 'Su Heng’s Martial Soul was a majestic goshawk with sharp eyes.', 'After he released his Martial Soul, Su Heng’s aura rose sharply.', 'His cultivation completely exploded.', '“Die, Su Mo!”', 'Su Heng roared and was the first to strike, clawing at Su Mo’s chest.', 'Su Heng used his strongest skill so he could defeat Su Mo in one move and let Su Mo know the distance between them.', 'He also wanted Su Mo to know what a joke his earlier pride was!', 'Su Mo raised his hand and punched Su Heng’s claw.', 'This was a regular punch without using Martial Soul or Genuine Qi.', 'Su Heng sneered. This good-for-nothing was so arrogant that he wanted to stop him with a punch? Impossible!', '“I’ll break you!”', 'Genuine Qi swiftly spewed from Su Heng’s hand, and his five fingers turned to silver spears. He wanted to break Su Mo’s fist.', 'What happened next was completely unexpected.', 'When his claw hit Su Mo’s fist, Su Heng felt a strong force that pushed his hand away and hit his chest.', 'Bang!', 'The fist squarely landed on Su Heng’s chest. A raging force surged from Su Mo’s fist, fracturing his chest with the sound of cracking bones. Su Heng was thrown about six meters away and crashed on the ground, spewing blood.', 'The audience was completely silent. All eyes were frozen on him.', 'Su Mo defeated Su Heng with a single punch?', 'The Fourth Elder looked at Su Heng, who was lying on the ground in a daze.', '“How could it be… How could it be?”', 'Su Heng was unable to accept the outcome and roared angrily with a twisted expression. However, just after he finished shouting, he was spitting blood again.', '“You called me a piece trash and a good-for-nothing every time you opened your mouth, but this piece of trash just defeated you with a single punch. Doesn’t that make you worse than trash?”', 'Su Mo said mockingly, walking to Su Heng and looking down on him.', '“You… ” Su Heng looked livid, ashamed, and resentful.', '“And you, Fourth Elder. Do you still think I’m useless now? I’ve defeated your prodigy, Su Heng, whom you thought highly of. What is he now?”', 'Su Mo looked at the Fourth Elder.', '“You only won through sheer luck. You have nothing to be smug about!”', 'The Fourth Elder’s expression was unpleasant. “The year-end clan meeting is in two months. When that time comes, you’ll realize the true abilities of the outstanding talents in our clan. You’re nothing compared to them!”', '“Through sheer luck?” Su Mo said with a smile, “I am quite lucky. Perhaps “through sheer luck”, I can achieve a high ranking in the clan meeting.”', 'At that, he turned around and left.']}, 'Chapter 9': {'Name': 'Purple Gold Pavilion', 'Translator': 'Transn', 'Editor': 'Transn', 'Story': ['Purple Gold Pavilion', 'In the yard, Su Mo kept swinging his fist with sharp whistling sounds and layes of fist shadows.', 'Bam!

He had already achieved the Great Completion Realm in just two days.', 'InNinefold Ocean Wave Fist, threefold fist force was a sign of crossing the threshold, fivefold fist force was a sign of Minor Completion, and sevenfold fist force was a sign of Great Completion. Now that he had achieved sevenfold fist force, he was not far from achieving ninefold fist force, which was a sign of the Completion Realm.', 'With his strength and physical force nowadays, Su Mo was not afraid of martial artists at Lv 4 Qi Cultivation Realm at all.', 'He did not rush to cultivate the scrolls in the storage ring, because it was more urgent to improve his cultivation.', '“I have to find a way to increase the rank of my Martial Soul,” Su Mo murmured to himself.', 'He was now performing both Qi Cultivation and Body Refining at the same time. He needed a great amount of Spiritual Qi for Elephants Strength Skill, but his Rank 3 Human Class Martial Soul did not absorb Spiritual Qi quickly enough.', 'The only way to improve the rank of a Martial Soul was to devour Beast Souls and other Martial Souls.', 'Devouring Martial Souls was not practical for now, since he could not kill people in the city, so he had to devour Beast Souls.', 'In addition to hunting for Beast Souls, he could also buy them with gold from any big shop in Sunnywood City.', 'However, they were not cheap. The higher the rank of demonic beast, the pricier its Beast Soul was.', 'As far as Su Mo knew, the Beast Soul of a demonic beast with Lv 3 or 4 Qi Cultivation Realm usually cost over one kilogram of gold each.', 'After pondering for a while, he had an idea and walked to the Master Mansion.', '“Haha! Mo’er, you came just in time. I have something to ask you.”', 'In the Master Mansion, Su Hong smiled at his son and asked, “Is it true that you beat Su Heng with just one move the other day?”', '“Yes.” Su Mo nodded.', '“Haha! Good, you proved yourself to be my son.”', 'After hearing his son confirm it personally, Su Hong was very satisfied. He knew that Su Mo might have encountered some miracles, but he did not inquire about them and just said encouragingly, “Mo’er, just keep trying. Even though your Martial Soul doesn’t have a high rank, you may still reach the Spiritual Martial Realm one day.”', '“Yes, Father.”', '“Alright. Why are you here?”', '“I have a favor to ask. Please help me,” Su Mo answered earnestly.', 'Su Hong was a little bit surprised by Su Mo’s seriousness and said, “Mo’er, I’m your father, not a stranger. Tell me what you want, and as long as I can do it, I will never decline.”', '“Father, I need 500 kilograms of gold,” Su Mo said.', 'He looked at his father nervously, for fear of refusal.', '500 kilograms of gold was not a small sum. Usually, the income of the entire Su family for a whole year was only 5,000 kilograms of gold, so 500 kilograms of gold was more than the Sus’ monthly income.', 'If Su Mo was still regarded as a genius, it would not be difficult to get him 500 kilograms of gold.', 'However, with his Martial Soul, he was regarded as a piece of trash. Even if Su Hong managed to get him the gold, he would be under a lot of pressure from the family.', 'Su Mo had asked for such a large quantity of gold because he wanted to buy a lot of Beast Souls. As long as he could get enough Beast Souls, the rank of his Martial Soul would soar, and along with it, his cultivation speed.', 'Su Hong was surprised. He stared at his son to make sure he was not kidding, but after a while, he nodded and said, “Wait here. I’ll be back in a minute.”', 'Then, he left.', 'He did not ask Su Mo why he asked for so much because he trusted his son.', 'Su Mo waited in silence, and soon, Su Hong returned.', '“Here are the gold tickets for 500 kilograms of gold. Take them!” Su Hong passed Su Mo several gold tickets.', 'Holding the tickets, Su Mo took a deep breath and said, “Father, I won’t let you down in the clan meeting in 2 months.”', '…', 'Su Mo headed toward the marketplace.', 'After an hour, he stood at the door of a big store. It had a gilded tablet with bold script that read: Purple Gold Pavilion.', 'Purple Gold Pavilion was a three-storey tower covering over 100 acres. It was the biggest store in the entire city. As long as you had enough money, you could get any cultivation skill, elixir, weapon, or anything else related to cultivation.', 'It was said that Purple Gold Pavilion had powerful connections, belonged to a major chamber, and had branches in many cities in Skymoon Country.', 'It held so much power in Sunnywood City that even the Sus and the Weis dared not to get in trouble with it.', '“How can I help you?” asked a young and beautiful maid reverently as Su Mo entered the pavilion.', '“I want to buy some Beast Souls,” Su Mo answered.', '“You want to buy Beast Souls? Come with me!”', 'Su Mo soon followed her to a counter that specialized in Beast Souls, where there stood an old man in gray.

I need to inform the leader of Pavilion. Please wait a moment!” the old man answered and rushed into the backyard of Purple Gold Pavilion.', 'Su Mo could do nothing but wait.', 'Soon, the old man rushed back and told Su Mo, “The leader of Pavilion would like to meet you.”', '“Show me the way,” Su Mo said.', 'In the backyard of Purple Gold Pavilion, there was a small house. Su Mo followed the old man into a side hall.', 'He was stunned when he got inside.', 'There was an extraordinarily stunning woman sitting in the hall.', 'She looked like she was in her late 20s, with refined facial features on her charming face, and her skin was snow-white.

He had rarely seen anyone like her, even in his past life.', '“Please take a seat, Young Master Su.”', 'Luo Huan arched her thin brow slightly and could not help but feel impressed by Su Mo.', 'She was very confident about her looks.

Don’t be so formal. My last name is Luo, and I’m a couple of years older than you, so you can call me Sister Luo,” Luo Huan said with an unwavering and charismatic smile.', 'Um!', 'Su Mo was dumbfounded, and then immediately nodded his head.', 'Luo Huan continued, “I heard that Young Master Su wants to purchase 200 Class 5 Lv 1 Beast Souls, but our pavilion only has 150. Would Young Master Su be willing to have the remaining 50 replaced by Beast Souls of other levels?”', '“Class 4 Lv 1 Beast Souls would be fine!” said Su Mo.', 'He did not mind that Class 4 were less effective because he could simply take more.', '“Yes, Young Master!” Luo Huan nodded, took out a gray pouch, and handed it to him.', '“Here are 150 Class 5 Lv 1 Beast Souls, and 85 Class 4 Lv 1 Beast Souls. That’ll be 500 kilograms of gold. Also, this storage pouch is a gift from me to you.”', 'Su Mo was shocked by her generosity.', 'This storage pouch was definitely not cheap. Even the cheapest pouches cost over 35 kilograms of gold.', '“Ha ha! Thank you so much, Sister Luo!”', 'Su Mo did not object and accepted the storage pouch.', 'After buying the Beast Souls, Su Mo immediately said his goodbyes and left.', '“My Lady? I heard that young master Su only has a Martial Soul of Rank 1 Human Class, why are you…?” asked a frowning old woman, who appeared silently in the hall.', '“Aunt Xu, Su Mo isn’t as simple as he seems.

As the Master, what right do you have to spend that much gold on your own son? The Sus doesn’t consist of only your family. I won’t allow it!”', '“That’s true. Su Mo is a failure.
